# File Metadata Microservice

The File Metadata Microservice project by freeCodeCamp is a Node.js API that can extract the metadata from uploaded files. It is a good project for beginners to practice building microservices, as it is relatively straightforward to implement and passes a variety of tests.

## To build your own File Metadata Microservice, you will need to:

> Create a new Node.js project and install the Express.js framework.

> Install the multer middleware to handle file uploads.

> Create a new route that handles POST requests to the /api/fileanalyse endpoint.

> Use the multer middleware to parse the uploaded file.

> Extract the metadata from the file, such as the filename, size, type, and creation date.

> Return a JSON object with the extracted metadata.

> Add error handling to handle invalid requests.

> Once you have implemented the File Metadata Microservice, you can test it by making POST requests to the /api/fileanalyse endpoint with different files. 

> The response would be a JSON object with the metadata of the uploaded file.

## Lessons / Example Usage 

> You can also use the File Metadata Microservice to extract the metadata from files that are stored on a cloud storage service, such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

> The File Metadata Microservice project is a good way to practice building microservices and learn about file metadata extraction in JavaScript. 

### It is also a useful tool that can be used to extract metadata from files for a variety of purposes, such as:

> Cataloging files in a file management system

> Identifying the type and contents of files for security purposes

> Extracting information from files to be used in other applications
